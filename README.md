# About The Black Tux
The Black Tux is reinventing the formalwear rental industry so guys can show up at their best on the days that matter most. The company designs and manufactures modern rental suits and tuxedos that actually fitâ€”made of 100% wool, ordered online or in one of our showrooms, and delivered for free. Using a combination of machine learning, tailor-trained fit specialists, and industry-leading customer service, The Black Tux guarantees a perfect fit every time.

To support this elevated customer experience we rely on lots of technology. From time to time we release things we build to the open source community when we feel they might be useful by others as well, and of course don't include anything proprietary.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed before starting:
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
* [serverless](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/)

## Installation
First install the package:

```
npm install serverless-plugin-cicd --save
```

Then add the plugin to your `serverless.yml` file:
```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-plugin-cicd
```

There are a number of parameters that you then can use:
```yaml
custom:
  cicd:
    image: 'the aws codebuild image'
    branch: 'the git branch you want to watch'
    owner: 'the GitHub repository owner where your project can be found'
    repository: 'the GitHub repository where your project can be found'
    githubtoken: 'the GitHub OAuth token if this project is private'
    excludestages:
      - '[name of a stage to exclude]'
      - '[another stage name to exclude]'
```

Or you can also store some parameters per stage by using the following (let us know if more should be per-stage):
```yaml
custom:
  staging:
    branch: 'the git branch you want to watch for the stage called staging'
  prod:
    branch: 'a different branch you want to watch for the stage called prod'
```
